I'm feeling like a tiny snowflake
Compared to the known and the unknown
Melting as I get closer
To the brightness of the star

Just as all the other flakes
Nothing special after death
Every snowflake melts
No matter how frozen

Either melting or freezing
In any form of being self

Just as all the other flakes
Only special when living

Either melting or freezing
In any form of being self 

Just a little snowflake
Compared to the universe
