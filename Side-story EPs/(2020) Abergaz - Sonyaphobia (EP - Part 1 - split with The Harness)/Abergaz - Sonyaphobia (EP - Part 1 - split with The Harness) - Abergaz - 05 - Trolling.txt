When you hurt somebody
You are just trolling
When you love somebody
You are just trolling
When you create something
You are just trolling
When you destroy something
You are just trolling 

Your jokes are not funny
Coz you are just trolling
You lack any empathy
Coz you are just trolling
You became a sociopath
Coz you are just trolling
You became a psychopath
Coz you are just trolling

When life is meaningless
Why would you make any sense?

Trolling, trolling
Down the river rolling
Trolling, trolling
Faking your emotions

When life is meaningless
Why would you make any sense?

Trolling, trolling
Down the drain rolling
Trolling, trolling
Back to feces devolving

When life is meaningless
Why would you make any sense?
