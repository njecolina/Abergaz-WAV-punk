This trauma is created
Through what is not done
And what are those, so called
Emotional fucking needs

Why do you want me
To suffer in silence
And taking me for
Emotional neglect 

If those needs are not met
We end up feeling empty
Why would you else 
Feel unimportant

Why should anyone block
Their negative thoughts
Why should anyone be ashamed
Of experiencing them

What about the feelings
And their mind-body responses
And all that thrive
To self-isolation

What is the fucking point
Of being alive
If you can't get mad for
Delaying the suicide

Why do you want me
To suffer in silence
And taking me for
Emotional neglect

Emotional neglect
Go fuck yourself
Get fucked
