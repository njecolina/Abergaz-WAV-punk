Once again on a local punk scene
A story happened, not that far away
From every meritocracy out there
Always the same responses

You pretend that you are an ally
Just to cash in on so called "safe spaces"
You're saying that you are not transphobic
Even when you are scared of me

Sonyaphobia
Because I expose your bullshit
Sonyaphobia
Because I exist too
Sonyaphobia
Because I see through you
Sonyaphobia
Because you can't fool me with your singing lies

Can't fool me with your singing lies
I see through your every fucking beat
Can't fool me with your singing lies
I do know what happened to you, to me
